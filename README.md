# [FYP] Anomaly Detection in Smart Farming via Machine Learning

[ ABSRACT ]
Internet-of-things (IoT) are used widely in smart environment in various industry
especially smart aquaculture where automations aids in increasing proteins yields,
farmer’s productivity and more. Despite the advantages of using technology in smart
environments, the integration of IoT devices tends to expose to various cyber threats
such as False Data Injection, and Malware Injection whereby could possibly harm the
data in cloud resulting wrong decision making. Developing a robust anomaly detection
system can identify environmental abnormalities while providing cybersecurity
safeguards against potential cyberattacks is crucial. Some studies have explored
machine learning for anomaly detection, yet research specifically targeting anomaly
detection in smart aquaculture via machine learning remains limited. This study aims to
observe suitable machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in smart farming
focusing on smart aquaculture. The study starts off with review of literature to identify
machine learning algorithms application focusing on anomaly detection. A comparative
analysis conducted to observe selected machine learning algorithms characteristic and
result from smart aquaculture dataset. Smart aquaculture dataset acquired from Kaggle
websites contains environmental parameter such as pH, temperature, and turbidity.
Synthetic anomaly data was injected in the acquired dataset to mimic the anomaly
situation. CRISP-DM methodology used for proof-of-concept on selected machine
learning algorithm. 70:30 of splitting ratio was used in training and splitting phase.
Random Forest (RF) algorithm was selected among Long short-term memory (LSTM),
Isolation Forest (IF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). To further evaluate the
algorithms, evaluation techniques such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and
ROC-AUC curve was used to compare algorithm performance. A risk mitigation was
proposed as the next step after anomalies has been detected. The study concludes that
machine learning was able to be implement for anomaly detection in smart aquaculture
environment. This contributes a more secure and reliable security measures for smart
environments.
